# AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Description

The dashboard uses data from the AdventureWorks’ database, which is a fictitious company data model. This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of AdventureWorks' financial performance, sales trends, product and customer insights. The visualizations allow users to monitor key metrics like revenue, orders, returns, and regional performance. The dashboard is interactive, offering filters and drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

## Key Features

•	Revenue and Orders Trends: Displays revenue and order data over time with a zoom slider.

•	Orders by Category: Breaks down orders and returns by product categories.

•	Top 10 Products: Highlights the top-performing products based on orders, revenue and return rates.

•	Regional Analysis: Shows total revenue by region (North America, Europe, Pacific).

•	ABC Classification: Categorizes products by their sales performance (A, B, C classes).

•	Product goals: Provides monthly product targets and their present position of metrics such as order, revenue, profit, returns and return ratio.

•	Customer Insights: Provides detailed customer purchase behaviors based on income level and occupation.

•	Custom Tooltips: Dynamic tooltips offer additional details on product sales and customer insights when hovering over specific visualizations.

## Custom Tooltip

The dashboard includes custom tooltips, which enhance the user experience by providing additional contextual data when hovering over certain visualizations. These tooltips are designed to show in-depth information such as:

•	Executive Dashboard: Hovering over a category in the Orders by Category chart and on the Map reveals the weekly total revenue, profit, order and returns, along with return percentage for that product.

•	Map: In the Map section, custom tooltips provide detailed breakdowns of the above mentioned metrics break down by region.

This feature allows users to quickly access detailed insights without leaving the main visualization, improving usability and interactivity.
